## In-class exercises

### Risk Analysis
You, a group of students from EK, have received a formal request from Copenhagen's EK Ølbar to develop a promotional website. For this reason, you decide to create a software development startup and achieve all tasks (design, coding, testing, documentation, domain registration, server subscription and maintenance). The requirements specification is the following:

- The web domain will be www.ekbeerbar.dk
- It will consist of the following web pages:
  - Home page. Including a promotional text, some photographs, and a brief history
  - Beer list. Including prices and separating bottled beer from beer on tap
  - Events. Concerts, magicians, and poetry readings take place every Friday
  - Contact. Phone number, e-mail address, postal address, and location map

You agree with the customer on having the web site active by January 1st, 2026.

**Exercise**

Work in groups of 5 or 6.

- Identify every possible risk
- For each risk
  - Give it an ID, a name, and a description
  - Estimate its probability and impact
  - Calculate its risk factor
  - Elaborate a list of possible mitigation actions
  - Establish status and follow-up dates
- Elaborate the corresponding risk table
- Elaborate the corresponding risk matrix
- Upload them in a pdf, xlsx or docx document to our Teams group (folder Risk Analysis)

[### Review]: #
[Review the following software requirements specification:]: #

[The application will consist of a data entry window and a data display window, which will obtain data from the former. It will include a printing option to print the information to a printer, pdf file, etc.]: #

[The data entry window will require the user to input the following customer information: first name, surname, address, city, postal code, phone number, date of birth, and preferred display colour (red, yellow, violet…). If the latter shows that the customer is under 18 years old, the text “Under-aged” will be displayed, showing the text “Adult” if the customer is over 18 years old.]: #

[Once the “Ok” button is clicked, the data display window will show all the information.]: #

[## Class takeaways]: #
[Check out the following slide decks on Itslearning:]: #
[- **Test Management**, with especial attention to risk analysis]: #
[- **Static Testing: Reviews**]: #
[  - Take a look to this video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaJ_nNk3f1o) that illustrates a code review, too]: #

[## Homework]: #

[**Requirements Specification Review**]: #

[Make 5 or 6 student groups.]: #

[This exercise has two parts:]: #

[- Part 1]: #
[  - Each group will write a short requirements specification for one of the following sample applications:]: #
[    - A currency exchange converter]: #
[    - A horoscope app]: #
[    - A measure converter]: #
[    - A sound meter]: #
[    - A mobile lantern]: #
[    - A stopwatch]: #
[    - A quote-of-the-day app]: #
[    - A metronome]: #
[    - An audio recorder]: #
[    - A notes app]: #
[  - Each group will upload their specification document as a pdf file to Teams (folder `Static Testing - Review Exercise/Software Requirements Specifications`). The name of the file will be the name of the application. Please add your names to the document]: #
[- Part 2]: #
[  - Each document will be assigned to another group for review]: #
[  - Before reviewing, each group will define roles:]: #
[    - 1 moderator]: #
[    - N reviewers]: #
[    - 1 scribe]: #
[  - Each group will upload a summary review report (pdf file) to Teams (folder `Static Testing - Review Exercise/Reviews`). Follow the format described in the slides]: #
[  - The name of the file will be the name of the application under review. Please add your names to the document]: #
